	I’m really happy with myself.
	“Ya know, Dr. Hey, I’ve got some good news for you.” Dr. Hey is my dentist.
	“Yeah? Whatcha got?”
	“Well you’re gonna be super proud of me.”
	I’m super proud of myself. I feel like a grownup.
	“I’ve started brushing my teeth regularly.”
	“…”
	“And none of that once-a-day bullshit that I’m sure your other patients do. We’re talking twice a day over here.”
	Pretty sure Dr. Hey wouldn’t give a shit.

	Congrats, I’ve learned to wipe my ass. I have learned to behave like a basic human being. I am now presentable in basic western society. I now do what every other adult does.
	“Good news doc, I am fit to introduce myself to people without repelling them.”

	Thank you, thank you everybody. It’s been a long transformation, and I’m glad I made it here today. I’d like to thank every dentist I’ve ever had, because invariably all of them have told me every single time that I needed to start brushing more. Mom, dad: thanks for supporting me by buying me toothbrushes and toothpastes. Without you, I would have to pay for them, and until my teeth start falling out, there’s no way I would shell out shekels for something that could easily be solved by the problem it causes.
	“Doc, I’m your boy. I’m the most responsible kid you’ve ever met. I schedule my own dentist appointments, I deal with insurance myself, and I brush my teeth twice a day as well. I pay bills, and I make money by selling my physical body to the military and an art school. There’s no stopping me now, I’m a death-dealing maniac with a toothbrush and some goddamn toothpaste.
	“I.
	“Am.
	“An adult.”

	“But do you floss?”
