	I have worn my whites all of four times. They look good, and as I get older and look less like a fetus, they look even better. So you can imagine my excitement when I realized I was going to get to travel cross-country in my whites.
	It’s not just that I had the opportunity to look respectable and important in front of strangers from Manchester to San Diego, but that I was representing a team and group similarly respectable and important people. When I wear that uniform, it doesn’t matter who I am.
	I am simply a Sailor.

	I arrived in San Diego at around 9:00pm on a Sunday night, the night before my cruise began.
