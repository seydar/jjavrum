	I enjoyed reading your essay. You talked about how you first got interested in playing the guitar, and you walked us through your musical development. You took us to music clubs, and you showed us various musical styles. You ultimately took us to the separation that invariably happens when kids hit high school; I went through the same separation, though I never returned but for brief sessions.
	I can tell that the guitar is something that means a lot to you. You really painted it in a wonderful light and were noticeably nostalgic for the entire piece. Your final page was really something I could connect with, and I totally empathize and sympathize with how you feel.
	Unfortunately, I feel like this essay is missing something. It felt like the forced reminiscence of the guitar, and we never really understood why you got into the guitar. Did Byron simply force it upon you? Were there any other points of inspiration? The scenes in the clubs with all the artists you’ve seen felt lacking as well. I wasn’t quite sure the point of it all; they felt very forced.
	I think you have a lot of good material here, but it needs some refining and remolding. I’m interested to see how the piece ultimately turns out, as it models my youth as well.
