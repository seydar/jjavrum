	This was an interesting piece to read. I thought your writing was very good on a technical level and the sentences and paragraphs flowed smoothly. I spent this weekend rereading old pieces I have written, so yours was a refreshing breath of air.
	You do a good job of introducing and realizing the characters in your story. I felt like I truly understood Rachel. I would like to see a little more of Alice, however. She holds greater import in this story and I would like to know a bit more about her. You seem to be targeting an idea of the ideal friend and using Alice as your champion of that idea; it would be more helpful to have a clearer idea of what this ideal friend is (which you define very well through the Montaigne example) and to have a clearer image of where Alice is now, how close she is, and how far she is.
	When I started writing this response, I wasn’t quite sure you had an argument to your piece — it felt more like an introduction of ideas. But upon further reflection, I feel that the argument you’re making is that of your friends and how it is to make friends. I think this could be strengthened by exploring your feelings on seeing Christina and Rachel drift away. How did you feel? Did you just let them fall off? What did you do after that? Were there any lessons you took from it other than "friends of convenience exist"?
