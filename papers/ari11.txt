	I have been thinking about being burned with a cigarette lately.

	Not about how I could do it, but just about what it’d be like.
	To take the cigarette in hand and pull it down to my forearm;
	to rotate my arm so that the soft, pale underside is exposed, away from hair;
	to put that cigarette to just an inch away from my skin—
		It barely looks lit, it doesn’t even feel hot.
	that rush as I know what’s about to happen.
		The stove is hot.
		Fire burns.
	The fear that overwhelms, that truly overwhelms, and grips ahold of me, and just doesn’t let go and then it’s all you can think and feel, and it’s too much and this is your chance your last chance to stop it and go back and move away from the edge from the brink of self destruction.
	To — without hesitating, for hesitation only serves to ruin — smoothly move the cigarette and push it into my skin, feel the nerves start firing, randomly, confusedly, with the sudden heat;
	to gently twist the cigarette and make sure that every nerve under the butt feels the heat of love the same.

	And then I hold it there.
	Not for long, but for about five or ten seconds. Just enough to bring the sensation, to welcome the sensation, to feel and endure the sensation, and then to let it go.
	A whole lifespan, fit neatly into my attention span.

	After I understand what’s happening, I pull it off. The skin is red and almost blistering. It’s searing, and the nerves are still firing. They’re less confused, now, and the pain is more consistent.
	I wouldn’t dip the wound in water or dirt or anything cold.
	I would just look at who did it to me,
								a girl.

	That’s how this fantasy goes: it’s always some girl who does it to me, who hurts me like this.
	I don’t really know what comes next, but I can only assume it’s love.
