	This is a very interesting piece to read. You talk about how you had to step up and learn English, and that you left China (or prepared to leave China? I wasn’t quite sure. I think It might’ve been all in China). You were scared of the new learning environment and toyed with the idea of giving up on learning English. Your mother persuaded you to keep with it. You even forsook your friends so that you could study English. It culminated with you studying the dictionary in a restaurant, completely forgetting to order your food. You are now confident in the classroom and ready for new challenges ahead.
	This was a wonderful piece to read, both because I can relate to the piece after having done much of the same work, and because of the insight we gain into you and English as a Second Language students. The way you write is also very interesting because, even though there are errors, the sentences still transport the reader and take us inside your mind.
	I’d like to focus on more of the structural components of the piece rather than the technical components because the errors you had were really quite manageable. Sure, they detracted from the flow of the piece, but they were minor.
	Your use of the phrase “For instance” makes it seem like you’re forcing much of the evidence to come forth. See if you can get it to flow by removing those sentences and having each paragraph evolve out of the previous paragraph.
	Honestly, that’s my only complaint. Your piece highlights very well how you have sacrificed much for learning English. It conveys this argument quite clearly and with sufficient evidence.
