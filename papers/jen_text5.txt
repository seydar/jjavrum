  • The 6 examples Kohlee and I worked together to chose are:

  • Example 1: The conversation between Patricia (over 85 years old) and her sister Natalie (75 years old) portrayed an exaggerated and well drawn out play-by-play of an ending to a phone conversation. All three parts of what I believe are vital to set up a closing are shown in great detail. First there is the closing initiation (or the preparation for the closing preparation), then there is the actual closing preparation, and lastly there are the final utterances. Each section is complied of two or more exchanges by each person (equal amount on both sides) so not only is this example very balanced but it is also exaggerated to show the details of a closing of a phone call.
  • Example 2: This terse conversation between Heidi (over 90 years old) and her son (55 years old) shows how a conversation can end extremely quickly after initiating a first closing preparation. In addition, in this example we can see that Heidi and Tom are in complete agreement about the time to close the conversation so in this case the closing preparation happens simultaneously and no negotiation is needed. This also prompted me to think about ages and how it is a pattern where the older person tends to finish the conversation when the younger person prompts for a closing preparation.
  • Example 4: I thought this conversation between Rachel (over 90 years old) and her daughter Amanda (68 years old) truly exemplified a classic mom/daughter sequence. Clearly Amanda wants to get off the phone and she fails to give more than one word feedback to her mother’s utterances. Thus Amanda really wants to get off the phone but it takes her a while to actually wind down the conversation and close it.
  • Example 6: This conversation between Heidi (over 90 years old) and her granddaughter Katie (early 30s) seems to be the opposite of the relationship/type of conversation in example 4. It is evident here that the granddaughter Katie calls to check in on her grandma and probably just to please her parents and her grandma (it is not really out of good will or to say something of importance). This conversation was an exception to the rest because here due to the nature of the reason for calling, the older person actually initiates the preparation for the closing and this forces the younger person (Katie) to end the conversation, which is atypical compared to the rest of the examples.
  • Example 7: I liked this selection of conversation because it goes back to the norms of closures in terms of age. Kim (the granddaughter in her early 30’s) attempts to close the conversation several times, which is common across most excerpts. However after many failed attempts of initiating the preparation for closure, it is actually the grandma (Heidi, over 90 years old) who then re-preps for closing thus causing Kim to say the last word in the conversation which is uncharacteristic of the other excerpts.
  • Example 10: The conversation between Megan (granddaughter, 40 years old) and Patricia (grandma over 85 years old) is a good one to end with because it showcases the main points that the other conversations together conclude. It shows prime examples of the types of words that are characteristic of the “preparation” and “actual closing.” It also demonstrates the age norms (younger person starts, older person has last word). Overall, it is a very clear and concise example of the conclusions I drew across all of the examples.



2. As evidenced through all six examples, there are clearly at least two (occasionally even three) parts that characterize a closing to a conversation between two people. There is the (1) the preparation for the closing and the actual closing utterances (2). The third part sometimes shown is the warning for the preparation of the closing, which precedes both the preparation and the closing utterances. After some sort of break or lag in the conversation, a person may deem it appropriate to prepare for the closing of the conversation. This is typically characterized with words like “alright” (example 2 line 4 & example 6, line 15) and “well” (example 4, line 32 & example 1, line 2 & example 7, line 33). The use of these specific words signals that the conversation is about to wind down and soon they will hang up the phone in normal cases. After one speaker suggests a pre-closing, it is up to the next speaker to either accept or reject the wind down.

After the initial warning that convo is ending a few other closing utterances will occur. Examples are: “Well I’ll talk to you again soon” or “alright honey” or “Well you have a good time tonight.” These types of phrases will occur directly after the first pre-closing phrase to demonstrate their understanding of the fact that the conversation is almost over and to show their acceptance of the close.

For example, in example 1, Patricia responds to Natalie’s preparation in line 3 by saying “Ok lots of lots dear.” In example 2, the responder (Heidi) answers Tom’s phrase “alright honey” with “Okay honey” and in example 4 Rachel immediately heeds Amanda’s warning to close by saying “always good to talk” (line 33). Heidi also responds to her granddaughter Katie’s preparation in example 6 by saying, “Ok dear spread the word” in line 18. Overall in all normal telephone conversations, one speaker initiates a warning that the conversation is going to terminate soon and the responder immediately responds (closing recognition) by signaling that he/she understands what the initiator was intending to do (all characterized under the pre-closing section). Sometimes pre-closings can involve several turn sequences and are thus slow-winding down preparations as in example 7 where the whole pre-closing section involves 8 lines of turn taking sequences. 

Another characteristic of pre-closings is that the younger person tends to begin the preparation for the close. This is turn, results in the older person almost always saying the final word within the close.

The actual closing is very terse and is usually no one than one turn-taking sequence. All 6 examples finished with the words “bye-bye” by both participants in the conversation. Both parts of the closing are characterized by pair sequences. In the preparation one speaker proposes a close and the speaker either accepts the close. In no case was a close utterance rejected. If it were to be rejected it is likely that the other speaker would have already hung up the phone. In the final closing, one speaker says a final goodbye and the responder answers with his/her final word. 

Of course there are always exceptions. In example 10, Megan does not really warn her grandmother that she is preparing for the close. Instead, she demands a close by blatantly stating that she does not want to talk anymore about this subject in line 17. Patricia interprets this as a demand to end the entire conversation now and prepares for close with the words “Okay…good enough.” Additionally there are cases when the responder rejects the preparation for the close. In example 6, Heidi attempts a close in line 42. Although Katie accepts the close Heidi starts up conversation again for several more turn taking sequences. It is then Katie who re-initiates a close in line 15 and Heidi accepts this close. Not only was this example an exception because the initial close failed, but the older woman was the one to first heed a closing warning. This is uncharacteristic of closes – in all of the other examples it is the younger person who initiated a close.



3.  The preclosing accomplished the work of getting the conversation ready to shut down in various ways. First no new or important pieces of information are being added during the pre-close. Except for exceptions, most pre-closings are characterized by alluding to when you will talk again (ex 7 line 41, ex 4 line 32) or sending best wishes (i.e. adding “I love you” or “always good to talk to you,” (ex 6 line 21, ex 1 line 4, ex 2 line 6). Under no circumstance is new information added. If new information is added then the conversation does NOT mark that an end is in sight. However in example 10, the speakers almost skip the preclosing and jump straight from normal conversation to the closing. Only the words “Okay” (repeated in the sequence) signal a preclosing. 

  
4. An ethnographic approach or a broader analysis of how a specific culture relates to the language would be useful to help explain these phone calls. Ethnography is interested in linguistic features that undermine some social meaning. Studying the cultural phenomenon of the relationship between a grandmother and her grandchildren or a mother and a daughter would be fascinating and key to the analysis of these conversations. It is likely that there is some sort of etiquette or unstated set of rules for talking to an elderly member of your family for some set period of time. I doubt all of these phone calls were “just to talk.” Many of these seem forced as if it is the younger person’s duty or job to call their mother or grandmother every week on Sunday. Thus these conversations are not 100 percent natural and instead they follow some sort of scripted element. So in this case it would be important to study the goals and purposes of the conversation and the outcomes.
