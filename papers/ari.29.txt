	Wow, this was a great piece. You really have a way with words that just made this all truly flow. You start off by talking about the role animals have had in your life, and then begin to get more specific. We see your dog Samson, then we visit Travis, your horse, and his utter attention to safety.
	And then you bring us to the chorus of the title when you ask your mom whether your pets will go to heaven. You even conclude a paragraph with a sentence that shouts-out to the closing sentence of your intro paragraph (wonderful!). Finally, you take us to the realm of the dead, and the largest story here is that of Misty. Misty 
	This was a wonderfully written piece. I genuinely have no comments on it. You clearly thought this all through, based on the clear parallelism and linking of parts, and the flow of the story is unperturbed. You do use the phrase “One day” quite a few times — it might be worth finding an alternate word to use.
	Have you ever lost any people that were close to you? You draw so many parallels between people and animals that a death of a person might make for an interesting comparison.
