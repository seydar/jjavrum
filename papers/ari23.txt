	Abigail, this is an awesome piece. This is absolutely fantastic. This is my favorite piece by anyone in our class. Your writing is technically fantastic, if a little flowery at times for my taste. The structure of the piece is great as well, using the setup of rebecca and abbey and then the parallelism of your experiences as a child. Really, this is brilliantly done.
	At first, I wanted to see more about Rebecca and Abbey in the diner — who were they? But then as I kept reading, I realized that who they are is unimportant and distracting. Speaking of distracting, the mole man: very confused by him. If I visualize this piece as though it were a short film, it would make sense because it could be seen, somewhat, as less deliberate and intrusive. The fact that this is writing means that your inclusion of him is very deliberate.
	I really don’t have many comments to give here, other than to clarify the confusing parts by adding breadcrumbs elsewhere. Don’t give too much away, whatever you do.
