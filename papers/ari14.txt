	Bob wants to do twenties.
	Well, Caleb told him to do so.
	It’s tough to watch because I’m concerned that Bob is going to ruin himself if he follows through with it. His hip can barely keep up with 40+ mi/week; doing multiple 20 milers will crush him.
	I’m not sure how to express how much this is a big deal, or how much running matters to Bob. And me.

	It starts with his key code for his housing card: 1642.
	1642 is the four-digit number Bob uses when he needs a security code of low import.
	1642 is what he thought about 5-6 times a day every day sophomore year.
	16:42 is his 5k PR. And it’s a nasty PR, too.

	It was sophomore year for Bob when he got that PR, so about 6 years ago. I’m not familiar with the details of the race. It wasn’t a culminating race of the season. It was just… a race.
