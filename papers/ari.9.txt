	We mustered at 9:00am in our whites, all of us looking to crush some first impressions.

	Big guys. Big muscles. Shaved heads or close-cropped hair. Water polo players.
	The classic archetype of a meathead.
	How the FUCK am I supposed to keep up with them in physical activity? I’m just a runner who is cursed with looking bigger than I am.

	We were herded into a classroom where we sat and listened to an Ensign speak to us about how things were going to work.

	The Lieutenant in charge of us, LTJG McElmoyl, took the podium. He said some words. Some sentences. I’m sure I was paying attention at the time, but given his intimidating imposition of stature and personality, I was more focused on absolute posture and an unblinking appearance of attention.
	“You will compete.”
	“You will compete with each other.”
	“You will put out.”
	“You will give 110%, 110% of the time.”

	Day 2 was the day to put out. Our initial PST.
