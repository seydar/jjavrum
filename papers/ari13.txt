	I’d love to have a Polaroid camera.
	When a moment happens, it happens and then it’s gone. There are zero copies.
	If you have a camera with a negative, you have infinite copies.
	If you have a Polaroid, you have one copy. You have one copy to show and hold on to. It’s just as special as the original moment because it is just as unique.

	So naturally, there’s the question of what I’d shoot if I had a Polaroid camera. I’ve learned to spend money on experiences, not things. When I went to Finland, I decided that the landscape would be easily remembered, and it was the people that warranted photography. I’d take pictures of my housemates, my friends, my teachers, strangers, you—

	I’m trying to think of whether it’s important that you’re a sophomore.
	Because if you were a senior, the picture would be special to both of us, one last fling as we head off in separate directions.

	But because you’re a sophomore, you’re staying here.
