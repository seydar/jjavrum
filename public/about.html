			<h2> What is JusTake?</h2>
			<p> JusTake is a website that helps connect people throwing away things that they no longer have a need for and people who could possibly have an interest in taking them. </p>
			<h2> So what's in it for us?</h2>
			<p>Nothing. Well not nothing exactly, the satisfaction of knowing that more things are being shared and less ends up in Landfills. According to the EPA (The US Enviromental Protection Agency) only -- percentage of ewaste is being recycled currently. That means -- % of TV's, Computers, and Cellphones end up going to the ground. And While this might be a great donation to the moles living nearby. No one wants a Mole uprising. No One.
